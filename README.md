POC for Business Driven Development using Cucumber and Gherkins


Basic steps for BDD using Cucumber:

Give pom dependencies for cucumber and junit.
Write the feature file in Gherkin language -> scenario with test data.
As per the feature file, write the step file using Regex.
Create test class that runs with Cucumber.
See the test case fail.
Then write the logic to make the test pass.
